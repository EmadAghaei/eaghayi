### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a toolmaker. My goal is to make developers more productive by providing better development tools and approaches. To create tools, I believe strongly in user-centered design. My research involves understanding developer behaviors, identifying problems, and designing tools to help with those problems using various HCI methods at each stage to achieve this goal.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Micrtask Programming approach
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning researching on Software Engineering
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on intersection of SWE and HCI.
